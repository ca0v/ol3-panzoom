OL3-PanZoom
===========

This repository holds a `ol.control.PanZoom` control, which consists of the
integration of the `OpenLayers.Control.PanZoom` and
`OpenLayers.Control.PanZoomBar` controls from OpenLayers 2 into OpenLayers 3.

![Sample](./examples/resources/sample.png)

The `ol.control.PanZoom` control makes it possible to migrate from OpenLayers
2 to OpenLayers 3 while keeping the style definition that was used to
customize those type of controls.
